# ConvPhaseGui

Reconstruct haplotypes from sequence data. Input and output can be in TSV or FASTA format.

This is a Qt GUI for [ConvPhase](https://github.com/iTaxoTools/ConvPhase), a convenient phase program that combines [PHASE](https://github.com/stephens999/phase) and [SeqPHASE](https://github.com/eeg-ebe/SeqPHASE).

## Windows and macOS Executables

Download and run the standalone executables without installing Python.</br>
[See the latest release here.](https://github.com/iTaxoTools/ConvPhaseGui/releases/latest)

## Usage

For information on how to use the program, please refer to the 1st section of the [Hapsolutely manual](https://itaxotools.org/Hapsolutely_manual_07Nov2023.pdf).

## Installing from source

Clone and install the latest version (requires Python 3.10.2 or later):

```
git clone https://github.com/iTaxoTools/ConvPhaseGui.git
cd ConvPhaseGui
pip install . -f packages.html
convphase-gui
```

If you are also compiling *ConvPhase*, you will need all of its [dependencies](https://github.com/iTaxoTools/ConvPhase#dependencies).


### Packaging

It is recommended to use PyInstaller from within a virtual environment:
```
pip install ".[dev]" -f packages.html
pyinstaller scripts/convphase.spec
```
